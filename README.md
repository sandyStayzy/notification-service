# Notification System

A scalable, extensible notification system built with Spring Boot that supports multiple notification channels and scheduling capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Maven 3.8+

### Setup Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE notification_db;
CREATE USER postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE notification_db TO postgres;
```

### Run Application

#### Option 1: Automated Startup (Recommended)
Use the provided startup scripts that automatically ensure all dependencies are running:

```bash
# Simple startup - automatically starts PostgreSQL and optionally Kafka
./start-simple.sh

# Advanced startup - comprehensive dependency management with health checks
./start-app.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running
brew services start postgresql

# Create database if it doesn't exist
createdb -U sandeepkumaryadav notification_db

# Optional: Start Kafka
docker-compose -f docker-compose-kafka.yml up -d

# Start the application
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
mvn spring-boot:run

# Or build and run JAR
mvn clean package
java -jar target/notification-system-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Alternative one-liner to kill port 8080 and start:**
```bash
# Kill port 8080 and start application in one command
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true && mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Stop Application
```bash
# If running with mvn spring-boot:run, use Ctrl+C to stop

# If running as background process, find and kill the process
ps aux | grep notification-system
kill <PID>

# Or use pkill
pkill -f "notification-system"
```

### API Documentation
Once running, visit: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

### Test the APIs

#### 1. Create a Test User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
  }'
```

#### 2. Send an Immediate Notification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Welcome!",
    "content": "Welcome to our notification system!",
    "channelType": "EMAIL",
    "priority": "HIGH"
  }'
```

#### 3. Send a Scheduled Notification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Scheduled Reminder",
    "content": "This is a scheduled notification",
    "channelType": "EMAIL",
    "priority": "MEDIUM",
    "scheduledAt": "2024-12-25T10:00:00"
  }'
```

#### 4. Check Notification Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/1
```

#### 5. Send Batch Notifications
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userIds": [1, 2, 3],
    "title": "System Maintenance Notice",
    "content": "System will undergo maintenance from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM EST",
    "channelType": "EMAIL",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "batchSettings": {
      "batchSize": 10,
      "delayBetweenBatches": 1000,
      "parallelProcessing": true,
      "continueOnError": true
    }
  }'
```

#### 6. Get User's Notifications
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/user/1?page=0&size=10
```

## Architecture Highlights
